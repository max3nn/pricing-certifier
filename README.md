# pricing-certifier POC

An engaging exploration into the validation and certification of dynamic live betting odds.

## Background

Imagine you're running a platform featuring live betting odds across a range of events. As these events progress, the odds dynamically adjust in realtime based on relevant factors. Betting involves intricate calculations, and without grasping the underlying mathematics and vulnerabilities, you could unwittingly become an easy target for seasoned professionals.

## Scope

The project's scope will focus exclusively on one sport and a single, specific betting style. Beginning with fundamental validation, the project will gradually evolve to encompass more sophisticated validation methods and intricate betting scenarios.

### Feature List 

- [ ] `Basic Validation` Perform data integrity checks to ensure that incoming odds and prices are in the correct format, within expected ranges, and sourced securely.

- [ ] `Market and Legal Compliance` Verifying that rates fall within a predetermined acceptable range, dictated by legal or compliance mandates.

- [ ] `Warnings & Event Syncing` Set up an alert system to promptly detect any anomalies or suspicious activities in real-time, enabling automated actions such as suspending or flagging markets that fail validation checks until manual review can be conducted.
